# VCash Wallet

This is the reference implementation of [VCash's](https://github.com/vcashorg/vcash) wallet. It consists of 2 major pieces:

* The VCash Wallet APIs, which are intended for use by VCash community wallet developers. The wallet APIs can be directly linked into other projects or invoked via a JSON-RPC interface.

* A reference command-line wallet, which provides a baseline wallet for VCash and demonstrates how the wallet APIs should be called.

# Usage

To use the command-line wallet, we recommend using the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/vcashorg/vcash-wallet/releases). There are distributions for Linux and MacOS.

Full documentation outlining how to use the command line wallet can be found on [VCash's Wiki](https://github.com/vcashorg/vcash/wiki/How-to-use-the-Vcash-wallet)
